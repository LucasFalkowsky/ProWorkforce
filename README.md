This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, initialize the Database with Prisma:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Build a prisma image

```bash
docker build -t prisma-engine .
```

Make shure docker is installed:

```bash
docker -v
```

Make shure docker is running:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

Initialise the Project:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Migrate the schema to the Database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the Application.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) with your browser to see the projects Storybook.

To gain access to a visualisation of the database run:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

Open [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555) with your browser to see the database.
